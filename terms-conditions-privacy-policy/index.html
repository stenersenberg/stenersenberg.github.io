        <p>Thanks for using Find Baby Names (Finn Barnenavn). We have a goal of making it easy, fun and secure for you
            to find a baby name</p>
        <p><b>Briefly summarized:</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li>All data we are storing (except e-mail) are anonymized.
            </li>
            <li>The only thing we store about you is your e-mail (you can opt out of this if you use Apple Login). We
                need to do this to be able to identify you as a user.
                By doing this we can offer you to log in on other devices, and keep the names that you like.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h2>More information</h2>

        <h3>Storing of data</h3>
        <p>Storing of data and login in is done by using the Firebase platform from Google. The following data is
            stored:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>E-mail (for login)</li>
            <li>Userdata,for example which names you like. This data is stored anonymously.</li>
        </ul>

        In some cases we use the anonymized data to gather statistics of popular names, make suggestions etc. These
        actions and data can not be traced down to your user. Suggestions are also handled anonymously.

        <h3>Delete your data</h3>
        <p>You can easily delete your data in the app. Just go to the settings menu in the app and press "Delete user"</p>

        <h3>Changes</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to change the privacy policy if we see it necessary. Big chances will be announced.</p>
